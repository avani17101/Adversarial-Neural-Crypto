# ADVERSARIAL NEURAL CRYPTOGRAPHY

Based on paper [Abadi, M., & Andersen, D. G. (2016). Learning to protect communications with adversarial neural cryptography. arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.06918.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06918)

 Work on training neural networks for real time encryption in multi-agent transmission and multiple adversaries. Trained LSTMs, RNN's and CNN's, Alice and Bob who transmit data protecting it from multiple adversaries trying various adversarial attacks of another network Eve.
